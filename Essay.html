			Did you know that after you reach the age of twenty you lose about one gram<br>
			of brain mass due to the neurons in your brain dying? Well now, there is a <br>
			way to regenerate brain cells using the stem cells from the zebra fish. We <br>
			think that the nervous system could be improved by using the cells from the <br>
			zebra fish's brain to give the brain the ability to regenerate brain cells.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We think that it is a good idea to give the human brain the ability to<br>
			regenerate brain cells because some people will get concussions resulting<br>
			in some damaged or dead brain cells, but if the brain cells can <br>
			regenerate, the brain will replace the damaged or dead brain cells.<br>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Brain cells could also be lost by suffocation, if someone was in a car<br>
			and the car crashed into a lake, the person and could not be able to get<br>
			to air in time. They would lose consciousness, and if that happened they<br>
			would begin to lose brain cells, if the brain could regenerate, brain cells<br>
			then the person would have some more time to be rescued and they could<br>
			regenerate the cells that they lost.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Some could say that it will not work because humans are a lot different from fish<br>
			but we are not using the entire brain, just the parts that make the cells<br>
			regenerate. In addition, people could say that there are much more important<br>
			things that could be redesigned but brain cell loss could result in things<br>
			like Alzheimer's disease or death.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In conclusion, we think that the brain should be given the ability to<br>
			regenerate brain cells by using the stem cells to regenerate neurons<br>
			because loosing brain cells could be extremely fatal and if you get a<br>
			head injury you would be able to replace old brain cells that<br>
			you lost in the incident.
